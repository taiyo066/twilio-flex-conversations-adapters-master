## Configure Incoming Webhook

1. Using [Postman App](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or cURL, send a request with the following to configure the webhook:
   - URL: `https://chatapi.viber.com/pa/set_webhook`
   - Method: `POST`
   - Headers: `X-Viber-Auth-Token` with the value of `VIBER_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Body (JSON):
     ```json
     {
       "url": "https://twilio-flex-conversations-adapters-<RANDOMNUMBER>-dev.twil.io/api/viber/incoming",
       "event_types": [
         "message",
         "delivered",
         "seen",
         "failed",
         "subscribed",
         "unsubscribed",
         "conversation_started"
       ],
       "send_name": true,
       "send_photo": true
     }
     ```

## Known Limitations

- Unable to verify Viber's webhook signature as Twilio Serverless Functions do not support BigInt (`message_token` attribute of the webhook payload)
