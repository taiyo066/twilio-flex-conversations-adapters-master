## Configure Incoming Webhook

1. Select `Google Chat API > Configuration`
1. Under `App Url`, insert your deployed incoming webhook
   - The Conversations Adapters incoming webhook URL should be in the format of `https://twilio-flex-conversations-adapters-<RANDOMNUMBER>-dev.twil.io/api/googlechat/incoming`

## Known Limitations

- Images sent from Flex Agent to End User will be invalidated after 300 seconds (Read more: [here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/conversations/media-support-conversations#platform-differences-for-media-messaging)). If you require longer validity, do consider extending the codebase to upload media to Google Drive.
- Google's Service Account Authentication for Google Chat API does not support Media Upload (i.e. Video). Read [here](https://developers.google.com/chat/api/guides/auth#asynchronous-chat-calls) for more information
